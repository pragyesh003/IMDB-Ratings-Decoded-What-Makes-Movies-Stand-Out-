**Project Description**

This project explores the relationships between various movie attributes and their impact on IMDB ratings. Using a dataset of the top 1000 movies based on IMDB ratings, this analysis delves into factors like runtime, Meta score, number of votes, and others to understand what influences a movie's success on IMDB.

**Technologies Used**

R Programming Language: For data processing and analysis.
Libraries: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, caret, MASS, rpart, rpart.plot, gridExtra
Dataset: IMDB Dataset of Top 1000 Movies and TV Shows

**Visualizations and Analysis**

Runtime vs. IMDB Rating: Positive correlation found suggesting longer films generally receive higher ratings.
Meta Score vs. IMDB Rating: Linear regression model indicates a quantifiable relationship, albeit with discrepancies suggesting varied preferences amongst viewers and critics.
Number of Votes vs. IMDB Rating: Demonstrates how voter engagement correlates with IMDB ratings.

**Insights**

The project reveals that while some attributes like runtime and Meta score have a significant impact on IMDB ratings, discrepancies in predictions suggest a complex interplay of various other factors affecting movie ratings. Viewer and critic perceptions, as well as the inherent variability in preferences, play a crucial role.
